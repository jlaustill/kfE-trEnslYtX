I created a phonetic alphabet for the fun of it, and went ahead and wrote a translator for english.  It's not robust or fancy, but it was sure fun!

The idea was to use only qwerty characters that exist on every keyboard already, which required doing some odd character choices, but I think I figured out a pretty decent result.

It works by first converting to IPA, then swapping characters.
